Wind Turbines in the U.S.
====
Wind energy was named the second highest source of electricity in April of 2022 trailing behind natural gas. This is a major milestone as last year wind energy was the fourth largest electricity source.
Although this is a big deal, the US is still lagging behind European countries such as Germany.

It has been reported by the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/04/world/un-ipcc-climate-report-mitigation-fossil-fuels/index.html">UN's International Panel on Climate Change</a> that wind and solar have declined in cost and are now economivally viable alternatives to fossil fuels. This could encourage more renewable energy production in the US, as there is a long way to go for more production of renewable enrgy.

**About the Map**

The purpose of this map is show map readers where major plots of wind turbines are located using icons throughout the United States along with the amount of power they produce per state using a chloropleth map.

Users are able to click on a wind turbine icon to the name of the group of wind turbines in that plot, the year they were placed, and the amount in that plot.

Data for the amount of wind facilities installed capacity per state was found <a href="https://neo.ne.gov/programs/stats/inf/205.htm">here.</a>
Data regarding the location of wind turbines came from <a href="https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uswtdb/data/">USGS.</a>
